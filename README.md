# Honours API - Timetable and Weather Data API

This API was developed as Part of My Honours Project at Glasgow Caledonian University.

The function of this API is to return the ferry timetables for some of Ferry Services within Scotland and the weather data for the ports on specific days.  

The other half of the Project can be found [here](https://github.com/Innex42/Ferry_timetable_app).
